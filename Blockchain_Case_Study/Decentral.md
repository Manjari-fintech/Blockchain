## Company Overview

Decentral, makers of the popular Jaxx cryptocurrency wallet, is Canada's largest blockchain startup. Created by Anthony Di Iorio and located in the heart of downtown Toronto, Decentral spawned the Ethereum Project, the Jaxx blockchain interface, and has been home to hundreds of blockchain community events.

In late 2013 Anthony Di Iorio funded & co-founded Ethereum, the decentralized smart contract platform that at its peak hit $150 billion in market cap. In 2014 he founded what is now Decentral Inc., an innovation hub & software development company focused on decentralized technologies. Decentral is the maker of Jaxx Classic & Jaxx Liberty, digital asset platforms that empower millions of people with the tools they need to control their digital lives.

## Products and Services

Decentral was home to Canada’s first two-way Bitcoin ATM and from time to time hosts community-driven events in the domains of fintech, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies. Their purpose is to champion the decentralized movement by building the technology that empowers and creates wins for all.

Decentral Academy is a trusted information portal for everyday people to access unbiased, comprehensive information about the power and potential of decentralized technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Decentral is primarily focused on their Jaxx product, the multi-token blockchain interface that provides a unified experience across 9 platforms and devices. Jaxx enables crypto-to-crypto buying and selling with frictionless in-wallet conversion. Users are always in control of their keys and Jaxx neither holds nor has access to customer funds. Driven by design and user experience and built with simplicity in mind Jaxx's mission is to become the interface to the blockchain world.

Decentral's digital asset wallet allows you to securely manage more than 90 digital assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dash, all for free.

Jaxx Liberty was built on the success of Jaxx. The new interface introduced a unified dashboard and module-based approach to provide information that everyday people need to navigate the cryptocurrency ecosystem through features including news, market data, portfolio and a multi-chain Block Explorer. 

In keeping with Decentral’s strong values around privacy, Jaxx Liberty is built around a business model that does not collect users’ personal information and respects their autonomy. Jaxx Liberty, like all previous versions of Jaxx, is a free service.

### Features of the Jaxx Liberty Wallet

One of the favorite features of the Jaxx Liberty wallet is its ability to store and transact with 90 plus different cryptocurrencies. Keeping all of these cryptocurrencies in the same wallet is a real convenience. Other features include:

**Buy and Trade Module** - Unlike most of the other wallets -that require multiple transfers in and out of exchanges every time you wish to convert your coins to another currency- Jaxx Liberty integrates shapeshift technology. Shapeshift refers to an in-built exchange that allows Jaxx Liberty wallet users to convert their digital assets from one coin to another within the wallet app increasing both convenience and security. In addition to Shapeshift, the Jaxx Liberty wallet also integrates with the all-popular crypto exchange – Changelly.

**Multi-platform support** - Jaxx Liberty is highly versatile and integrates with virtually all popular operating systems. There are different versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop operating systems. The wallet is also available in both Android and iOS smartphone app versions as well as via a chrome browser extension.

**Unified Dashboard** – The Jaxx Liberty dashboard gives a single place to see all your wallets and gives you a complete picture of your holdings.

**Portfolio** – Keep abreast of the value of your holdings in real-time with the portfolio module.

**News Viewer** – Now integrated into the Jaxx wallet is a blockchain news viewer so you can keep up on all the new developments and breaking news from the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.

**Market Data** – Get price, trends and market caps of all your favorite cryptocurrencies with a click or tap.

**Blockexplorers** – Interact directly with the blockchain and see transaction data and other raw data points for multiple blockchains.

**Cross Platform** – Support for both desktop and mobile lets you interact with your assets at home or on the go.

**MyJaxx** – A gamified experience to promote engagement with partners, designed to entertain and inform people as they navigate the Jaxx ecosystem.

### Cost and Fees

Both the desktop and smartphone Jaxx Liberty Crypto wallet apps are free to download and install. You, however, will be charged a small transaction fee every time you send coins from your wallet or use the inbuilt exchange to convert your assets from one coin to another.

There are three classes of fees that include low, typical, and higher fees depending on the number of currencies being transacted, and the speed at which you would like the transaction completed. Interestingly, however, these fees all go to the blockchain miners confirming the transactions.

### Security Features

**Anonymous trading** - Jaxx Liberty collects as little information about their Crypto wallet users as possible. The wallet doesn’t ask for any of sensitive user information. This ensures that even if the platform was breached, their user’s privacy is guaranteed.

**Password protection** - You get to set up a strong password upon activating the Jaxx Liberty Wallet. The password is unique to your wallet, and you will need it every time you want to log into the app or confirm a crypto transaction.

**Recovery seed** -  Like virtually every other crypto wallet, Jaxx Liberty has a 12-word backup seed. You get to generate this during the app setup, and it comes in handy in helping you recover your private keys, should you misplace/lose your device, or forget your password.

**Hierarchical deterministic** - A hierarchical deterministic wallet is a wallet whose design allows it to generate different random addresses for different transactions. It implies that every time you transact with the Jaxx Liberty wallet, it will generate a random public key. This goes a long way in masking your real public key and swaying off hackers.

### Jaxx Liberty Wallet Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- The wallet is compatible with virtually every operating system.

- Jaxx embraces a raft of security features, including the fact that it is hierarchically deterministic.

- The wallet is user friendly and easy to interact with, for both beginners and experienced crypto-traders.

- The Jaxx Liberty wallet is feature-rich, and you don’t have to leave the app to transact or get market information.

- Acquiring the Jaxx Liberty wallet is free and maintains inexpensive transaction fees.


**Cons**:

- The main downsides of the Jaxx Liberty Wallet are that it does not support as many crypto assets and tokens as other wallets, users cannot purchase assets directly through the app using fiat, and support is only available through email and social media contact.

- Jaxx wallet was breached in 2017, and hackers made away with over $400,000 worth of coins.

- The wallet is incompatible with hardware wallets. 

- It’s a hot wallet and, therefore, requires you to maintain powerful antivirus software to keep malware out, which might be costly over time.


### Comparison with Competitors

Comparing Jax Liberty against most other hot wallets like Coinbase, eToro, and Electrum, it has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. Unlike the smartphone Electrum wallet, for instance, Jaxx Liberty isn’t compatible with the more secure hardware wallets and also supports a fewer number of crypto coins. 

Given the wallet’s association with De Iorio, a renowned blockchain specialist, and Ethereum co-founder, one would expect Jaxx Liberty to be one of the most formidable wallets out there. Its support for just handful currencies, a history stained with a significant security breach, and subsequent loss of clients’ funds, as well as the lack of solid security features like the 2FA(two-factor authentication) or face ID, dents its reputation. However, it’s easy to use and feature-rich platform, makes Jaxx one of the best crypto wallets for beginners and low-volume traders. 

## Other Decentral products in pipeline

**Decentral Unity (JXX) Loyalty Token** – A rewards system to encourage people to use Jaxx Liberty and engage with partners.

**Jaxx Hardware Wallet** - Decentral is planning on releasing a hardware wallet, which will be called the Cube Ice and will pair with a larger hardware device called the Cube. The devices were first announced in May 2016 and the Cube is meant to complement home entertainment systems and will come preloaded with a number of blockchain nodes.

## Funding

Decentral Inc. seems to have no record of funding from an outside party.  The firm was likely bootstrapped by Founder, Di Iorio, as he provided much of the funding for the Ethereum project, which was the first major project that led to the creation of Decentral.

## Why this is interesting

Jaxx Liberty overcomes the fragmentation in the cryptocurrency landscape by providing users a single, unified experience for accessing the tools they use day-to-day to manage their digital lives across more than 90 cryptocurrencies.

It’s a great choice for those new to the world of cryptocurrencies, and yet it remains feature rich enough for experienced crypto users.

## Conclusion

The mission of Decentral Inc. is to be an innovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies. The company aims to lead the Canadian blockchain market into the future by playing host to community-driven events from time to time. For now, its main focus is the Jaxx Liberty wallet.
